# CAD
All of the models that were used in this project were designed in OnShape. Since the platform doesn't export entire projects, I won't post the files here.
You can check out the CAD at [OnShape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ba6eefc270d24b4c9dd6e786/w/6963f8d8a0a2caa2323001ec/e/34bf19d81762a19b936466c0?renderMode=0&uiState=6856d5456c3c941bc04f44d6), and if you make an account you can download all the models.

The CAD includes:
The shell (top and bottom), which slides together
The touchpad bracket that keeps the touchpad in place
Demo pcb's so I could figure out how the pcbs would fit before I ordered them
